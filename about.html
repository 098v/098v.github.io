        My Story
      </div>
      <div class="story-p">
        <p>My love for design had started out during elementary school but hadn't fully grown until my freshman 
        year of high school where I had taughtmyself as much as I could about graphic designing, which had later 
        brought me into the world of 3D modeling. Now entering my final years of high school I've taken classes 
        that have helped improve my skills in designing and I am going to be taking a CO-OP class where I will be 
        taken to a place that will help me improve my graphic designing skills further.</p>
